Pygame Project

Really enjoyed this one. Spent a good portion of a day working with the supplied tutorial. I had actually attempted this
tutorial previously but hadn't gotten Pygame to work in pycharm, but got it fixed the second time at it. This project was
very stimulating to someone interested in a career of level design in games, just to see some basic mechanics for collisions
input and movement. I worked through all of the code with the video, which I found to very valuable. I liked being able to
add sound effects for different things happening, and I see loads of potential for what could be done with that in future
projects. The additions I made to the game included a level display, which increases every 15 points scored. I made it so
that an additional point is added as soon as you get to each point requirement, as the level indicator would increase rapidly
when the players score was at 15,30, etc. I also added some sound effects for when a new level is reached, different bird
sounds to congratulate you on your progress. There is also now a goose button which I sadly could not demonstrate in the
Licecap gif. I enjoyed this project and look forward to using pycharm and pygame in the future.
